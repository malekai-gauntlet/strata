# MAKING HISTORY

Strata has developed a revolutionary approach to education that combines academic excellence with athletic achievement. We are the only education system capable of delivering top 1% results with just 2 hours of daily academic focus, and in 2024 our Alpha School became the first to prove this model works. By 2028, we'll transform Texas into an educational powerhouse. Click through the timeline below to see our planned milestones.

## Timeline

**2024 - ALPHA SCHOOL PROVES THE MODEL**
First implementation of 2 Hour Learning proves students can reach top 1% nationally

**2026 - STATEWIDE TRANSFORMATION BEGINS**
1,200 schools, one Strata School per district

**2027 - RAPID EXPANSION**
5,000 schools, multiple sports academies per district

**2028 - EDUCATIONAL DOMINANCE**
10% of Texas students, top 1% national results

# REVOLUTIONARY APPROACH

Strata believes a fully scalable and replicable school model is the pivotal breakthrough needed to substantially improve education access. Traditional schools require 6-8 hours of academic time daily, yet struggle to achieve top results.

Compare that to a Strata School â€“ we achieve better results in just 2 hours, freeing the afternoon for sports excellence. Following this model, we can reduce the barrier to world-class education while simultaneously developing athletic talent.

# Implementation

Strata's implementation process is designed for rapid scaling while maintaining excellence. We handle everything from finding families to securing locations to managing compliance.
